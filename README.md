# Frontend Portfolio v1.0

This repository contains my first frontend simple portfolio website, built using
semantic HTML and CSS.

## Focus
- Clean, readable structure
- Responsive layout (mobile-first)
- Practical problem solving (tables, forms, navigation)
- No frameworks or JavaScript

## Status
Version 1.0 — layout and structure finalized.

## Notes
This project is intentionally simple and serves as a foundation before moving
on to more complex frontend work.
